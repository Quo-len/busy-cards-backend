## .env Setup

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following environment variables:
   PORT=
   WS_PORT=
   SECRET=
   SESSION_SECRET=
   DB_LOGIN=
   DB_PASS=
3. Fill in the values according to your environment or server settings.
4. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid exposing sensitive information.
